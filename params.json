{"body":"**tambola**\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis is a online tambola playing web application. \r\n\r\nPresently many users can play the same game but the notification of winner is not done\r\n\r\n> It is written to teach the basics of google appengine to students.\r\n\r\nThis project implements following from **google app engine** and **objectify library**\r\n\r\n  * The folder structure of publishing apps on google app engine in Java.\r\n  * How to save and retrieve data from the google datastore using the _objectify library_\r\n  \r\nFor the frontend of the application I have used a very good responsive framework by [Zurb](http://zurb.com) known as [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com)\r\n\r\nThere are very good technologies. This project uses the least use of that but in the end \r\n> It's just to light the fire inside you\r\n\r\n[Ashutosh Singh](http://facebook.com/t0m.ashu)\r\n  \r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
